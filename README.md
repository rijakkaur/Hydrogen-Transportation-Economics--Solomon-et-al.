# Hydrogen Transport Cost Analysis 

This repository contains the Python scripts developed during my online internship as part of the project on techno-economic modeling of hydrogen transportation via trucks and pipelines.

## Contents
- `cost comparison-trucks.py`: Plots comparison charts for LCOHT(€/kg) for 350 and 540 bar trailers across various transport distances.
- `cost comparison-pipeline.py`: Plots comparison charts of LCOHT(€/kg) for 100, 150 and 200 mm diameter pipelines across various transport distances.
- `3D plot-pipeline`: Plots least LCOHT as a function of hydrogen demand and transport distance.
- `Hydrogen economic-Solomon.xlsx`: Contains all relevant inputs for the model.

## Internship Context
These codes were developed as part of my internship project titled **"A Process Engineering Analysis of Compressed Hydrogen Gas Transport via Trucks and Pipelines"**, conducted under the guidance of Professor Asad Hamid Sahir, Assistant Professor, Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar,, during May-July 2025.

## Acknowledgment
Heartfelt gratitude to my mentors for their guidance throughout the project.
